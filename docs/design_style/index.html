      <h1>Art Nouveau</h1>
      <p>
        Art Nouveau is a decorative design movement inspired by nature,
        flowing forms, and handcrafted detail.

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        Art Nouveau emerged in the late 19th century as a response to
        industrialization and mass production. Designers sought to
        restore beauty and craftsmanship to everyday objects.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Organic, flowing “whiplash” lines</li>
        <li>Nature-inspired motifs such as flowers and vines</li>
        <li>Decorative typography and illustration</li>
        <li>Emphasis on craftsmanship and artistic unity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Art Nouveau helped bridge traditional art and modern design by
        integrating aesthetics into architecture, graphic design,
        typography, and everyday objects. Its influence can still be
        seen in contemporary branding and visual storytelling.
