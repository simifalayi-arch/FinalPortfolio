    <h1>Swiss Style:<br>The International<br>Typographic Style</h1>

    <p>
      Swiss Design, also known as the International Typographic Style,
      is a graphic design movement that emphasizes clarity, objectivity,
      and readability. It uses structured grid systems and sans-serif
      typography to communicate information in a precise and universal way.

  <!-- HISTORY -->
  <section>
    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      Swiss Design emerged in Switzerland during the 1950s, influenced by
      earlier modernist movements such as Bauhaus and De Stijl. Designers
      like Josef Müller-Brockmann sought to remove unnecessary decoration
      and focus instead on rational organization and clear communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      The style became internationally influential due to its effectiveness
      in signage, editorial design, and corporate identity systems.
